The APOD app shows a collection of the last 30 images provided by the NASA api. Everyday, at midnight USA eastern standard time (USA East Coast time), a new pictured is added to the collection.

The pictures rendered by the app include images and videos. The app provides the user with a select option, to show a separated list of images or pictures. By default, the app shows the combined list of images and videos, under de option "Both".
